# Fruit-Freshness-Detection
The project uses OpenCV for image processing to determine the ripeness of a fruit.

### Running
A camera is connected to the device running the program.The camera faces a white background and a fruit.
The program is executed and the ripeness is obtained.
The ripeness is calculated based on simple threshold limits set by the programmer for te particular fruit.

### Possible Improvements:
- Detecing multiple fruits in an image and labelling each with ripeness index
- Support for different kinds of fruits with a computer vision model to determine type of fruit
- Determining fruit quality fromthe image by detecting damage on fruit surface
